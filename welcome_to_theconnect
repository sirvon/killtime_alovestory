The Day He Comes 2 theconnect.

    @ his juvi program, he's put into confinment for having a facebook acct and an overabundunce of
    android and iphone programming books.
    
    the numinati have been monitoring he's fb + ig accts and realize he's on the verge of blowing up
    of putting out the next google, coming out with the next illmatic, ready to die, all eyez on me.
    they realize now is the time to take him in + take over his creations.
    
    so he's, transported from the juvi place, he's in a rage ( a kind rage b/c he's a kind boy ) he
    doesn't know wtf is going on he can't see he can't hear he's in a van that been moving for hours
    + he doesn't know where he's headed + then is dragged from the van and put on a plane. And that
    did it, he starts to vomit everywhere and anywhere his head bobs to. he then starts to
    hyperventilate, b/c this is the first plane ride he's ever been on.
    
    he's like the last person to get to the connect. he finally gets to theconnect building + is
    able to hear and see + on 1st sight he sees this loft like space of 50 or so ppl all playing with
    mobile devices. and he instantly collapes. this is like a dream come true he has this billion
    dollar change the game idea + all he needed was a team of programmers and engineers @ his ready
    and it damn sure looks like what's in front of his eyes. he just when from the worst juvinile
    detention center in his 9 years of confinemnt to "the googleplex"
    
    
    {
    
     in these transitions, he is a rough ashlar, he is young, immature emotionally, unstable still
     unpolished
    
     in these sequences, he + jin meet, if not in close presence but just thru eye/radience/bdy lang/energy
     put it like this they know each other are near.
     
     }
