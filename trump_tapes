trump tapes fan club

  as he produces these tapes, he weaves hidden clues to his true purpose of exposing theconnect's whereabouts,
  with the tape series. the only way to discover these clues are thru purely random/chance occurances which he
  knows will lead to the clues being presented to the correct ppl. b/c he knows evthing happens for a reason
  thats the nature of nature, the life of life so he knows when some random event reveals his clues to some
  listener that that trumptape fan is the chosen one to go forward w/ the clue and seek + find + destroy
  or perhaps build...
  
  he also knows that this tape series, that this expose of theconnect can't go on forever. b/c the numinati
  arent naive regardless of how niche or how boutique the spread of this undertaking they will find out and
  protect their interest. he's certain this will happen, he's just not sure of the consequences top be
  expected, his life is definetly in danger b/c of these tapes but he's been all in since he left theconnect
  but the question he fights w/ daily is, is he putting his friends in theconnect @ harm? is this experiment 
  just another experiment and it'll jus b shut down @ a moments notice of exposure or has the incredible influence
  theconnect has had on modern society so concrete that his folks have basically secured thier existance, that 
  theconnect too just as he have granteed thier exisitance because of how brutally they are corrupting society
  with their unseen hands? he is a optimistic skeptic, a controlled speculator but he doesn't want to be, he
  really wants to belive. He wants to belive the only way to stop this this experiment this real life truman
  show that he and hes family by nature, have created can only end if they perform a group sucide.
  
  he doesnt want to belive that but it is what it is, forever.
