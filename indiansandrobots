    Let a ultramachine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man
however clever. this is why in the words of Jin, "Yall fucking stupid", to the characters in theconnect
using theconnect to scheme, sell d.rugs + gamble + rob + coerce + manipulate instead of creating software
+ more intellegent devices to do 1million times what a mere human can do a billion X more clever.
 
 
    So there's this dichotomy in characters in theconnect. we'll call one group indians + the other robots.
Indians + Robots is a animated short w/in the killtime love story that some lil kid is always watching,
on a tablet. It depicts in cartoon/comical/satire form the relationships btw the characters in theconnect.
 
    The Indians + Robots internal struggle w/in theconnect is a strong characterization of whats going on in
the greater society, the natural trend towards uniform social consoladation.

    Evbdy in theconnect has a past, if they didn't have an eventful past they would nvr made it to theconnect.
Thier past kinda like defines who they r, where they'll travel. Most of the indians have past relating to "criminalogy"
or what society deems anti-social behavior. the robots on the other hand come to theconnect w/a disconnect of thier
emotions from thier actions. no less more fucked up even to be considered a kinda of crime in itself when those
disconnects starts correlating to crime.
